Created a Javascript program with Node.js that allows the user to specify an amount of money for deposit, bet on a slot machine, and share their results
The project was created with the help of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XxeE7NF30
I added the ability to copy the result of a slot machine spin to the user's clipboard, a graphical representation of the slot machine, and an ending statement that returns the total amount of money gained or lost
